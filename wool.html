                    <p class="callout"> ONCE UPON A BRAND </p>
                    <p class="copy">As part of low-fidelity design work at General Assembly, I was asked to create a new brand for a hypothetical
                        outdoors company, using the following descriptor for inspiration:</p>
                    <div id="intro_descriptors">
                        <p class="descriptors">“simple, reliable, aspirational, established”</p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="copy">Below is a deep dive on how (and why) I chose to brand <strong>wool</strong>. In particular, Blue Faced Leicester (BFL)
                        wool, the best kind of wool you've probably never heard of.</p>
                </div>

                <hr>

                <div id="research">
                    <h2>research</h2>
                   
                    <p><strong>Secondary research</strong>&mdash;I looked at competitors' price, product options, pitch, values, and partnerships. Reading into their history I found a common message about sustainability, community, and patriotism.</p>
                    
                  
                    <div id="first-chart">
                        <img src="images/wool/googlechart.png" alt="">
                        <p> Common theme: Most of the companies
                            had some form of design philosophy.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p><strong>Theme and style</strong>&mdash;Evoking either athleticism or tradition, there was little overlap in style between brands. I saw an opportunity to blend attributes of both; warm tones with vector imagery.</p>

                        <div id="first-chart">
                                <img src="images/wool/custompreset.png" alt="">
                                <p> Brands conveyed athleticism with bright colours, scenic photography, and vector images or tradition with soft colours, photos of families, and use of serif font types.</p>
        
                            </div>

                    <p>At this point, I discovered BFL wool, its rich Canadian history, and its high-quality features. Majority
                        of the leading quality brands were from Europe, targeted to adults, with a predominately serious tone to their brand story. I saw another opportunity.</p>
                    
                        <div id="intro_descriptors">
                        <p class="descriptors">why not bring european standards to canadian youth markets?</p>
                    </div>

                    <div id="first-chart">
                            <img src="images/wool/VoiceTone.png" alt="">
                            <p>The features of European brands combined with BFL wool's Nova Scotian history were the basis for a brand
                                    story on heritage that was authentic, patriotic, and new. I deliberately chose a fun and playful
                                    brand image as an opportunity to stand out and connect with younger audiences.</p>
    
                        </div>

                </div>

                <hr>
                <div id="missionstatement">
                    <h2>vision &amp; mission statement</h2>
                    <p>Vision and mission statements bring authenticity to the brand. 
                     I used the descriptors' synonyms to brainstorm the brand's vision and mission statements. </p>

                        <div id="first-chart">
                        <img src="images/wool/valuesynonyms.png" alt="">
                            <p>Highlighted synonyms of each respective descriptor work well together to support the brand's name and style (its' Canadian history, quality wool, etc.)</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Ultimately creating a statement that can guide the overall experience the users expect from the company.</p>

                        
                        <div id="first-chart">
                            <img src="images/wool/missionstatement.png" alt="">
                            <p>What does it mean to be simple? In what ways is the [company, product] simple? What does it mean to be reliable?</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>The more authentic a company's branding and marketing → the more likely
                                customers will feel a connection with the imagery the products are attempting to convey →
                                the easier it is to design and build an experience to support that image.
                            </p>

                    </div>
                  
                <hr>

                <div id="moodboard">
                    <h2>mood board &amp; style guide</h2>

                            <p>Images evoking: "50s feel". Inspired use of bright, warm, and soft colours in the style guide.</p>

                        <div id="moodboard-column">

                            <p>Images evoking: "fabric, humble, familiar, comfort". Inspired ideas on how to showcase wool on
                                a web interface.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div id="moodboard-column">
                            <img src="images/wool/fabrictradition.png" alt="">
                            <p>Images of "fabric, tradition, heritage". More logo inspiration, using a more minimal style.</p>
                        </div>

                    </div>

                    <div class="intro_descriptors">
                        <p class="descriptors">kiss; keep it simple stupid</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Despite enjoying the process of building each mood board I struggled because I had created too many, having put more work than necessary. As a solution, I looked for one common theme within each mood board and allowed it to represent a component of the brand.</p>

                
                                <p><strong>Colour</strong>&mdash;The shades of blue, orange, and green work in harmony to show warmth, familiarity, and fun.
                                    They were inspired by the rich, vibrant colours used in products in the 1950s and the
                                    sunsets on the coasts of Nova Scotia.</p>

                            <br><br><br><br><br><br>
                                <p><strong>Typography</strong>&mdash;I wanted to use a clear and minimal font that was versatile enough for written content (various
                                    weights) but clean and legible enough for showcasing products on all interfaces.</p>

                <div id="logo">
                    <h2>logo</h2>

                    <p>Creating the logo was an extensive process.It was difficult to pick just one style and refine it, since every style could lead to a new kind of logo.
                            At some point, I needed to stop having fun.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>diverge</strong>&mdash;Letting go is hard. I did user tests with a group of people to ultimately discover that none of these were great.</p>

                    <p><strong>converge</strong>&mdash;I liked the idea of using an actual
                            sheep to add character to the logo with the background resembling a ball of yarn.

                    <br><br>To balance the modern colours and vector style of the brand, I used a serif font, Cinzel.
                            
                    <br><br>I wanted the font to look good whether it's abbreviated or lengthened. I widened the space between the letters so it appears
                                    balanced next to the sheep icon.</p>

                <div id="uielements">
                    <h2>ui elements</h2>

                    <p>The UI elements were inspired by how strings overlap each other, creating knots and shadows yet are simple and clean at its core. 
                    <br><br>
                    <img src="images/wool/UIYarnDrafts.png" alt="">
                    
                    This helped define major features of
                    the design system with illustrative and functional iconography. Eventually creating a fun and playful shopping visual experience
                    with reactions to user inputs that are as playful as the brand.</p>
