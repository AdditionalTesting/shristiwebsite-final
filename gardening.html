                            <p>3.

                                <strong>The expectations are unvarying</strong> because it's a direct response to the initial problems that
                                users had. Instead, they help guide the design and layout of content. However
                                <strong>the layout is varying</strong>, changing often through user feedback and iterations in order to find
                                the best user experience that meets the expectations.

                            <br>
                            <p>For example, users that knew about gardening but were unfamiliar with the platform were grouped seperately
                                from users that did not know anything about gardening but were familiar with the platform. </p>
